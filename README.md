# Mustang
## Project 4 Objective
To utilize and train a machine learning model to predict outcomes based a dataset.

### Goal
To create and optimize the best machine learning model to predict the winning horse.

### Data Collection
Used 2 datasets from this website on horse-racing data around the world in the year 2020.

### Data Cleaning
Merged the two datasets and dropped unecessary columns and rows with missing information. We utilized MongoDB and SQL to input the dataset into a database to further analyze the data with different tools.

### Attempted Machine Learning Models
Tested multiple machine learning models including Neural Network, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest, etc. The machine leaning models used in the presentation were the models with the best outcomes. The models mentioned were Neural Networks and the Decision Tree.
